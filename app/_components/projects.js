          important moments. Eventually, I was curious about how to edit
          stunning videos I've watched on YouTube, Facebook, and other
          social media platforms. I remember my first video upload on my
          Facebook page; it had a lot of glitch transitions and
          over-saturated adjustment color, but it was a good start.
          Recently, this year, 2023, I made a promotional video for my
          hometown, Anda, Pangasinan, focusing mainly on our tourist
          attraction, the Tondol White Sand Beach - Little Boracay of
          the North.`}
